				<strong>Enterlink</strong> and its resident AI, <strong>VEA</strong>{" "}
				(“Virtual Entertainment Ambassador”), serve as your digital concierge
				for discovering and creating virtual events. Our platform connects you
				with a variety of online experiences—ranging from social gatherings to
				specialized niche events—while also providing{" "}
				<strong>user-friendly tools</strong> for <strong>communities</strong>{" "}

				<strong>event creators</strong> to{" "}
				<strong>organize, share, and manage</strong> events. Whether you’re
				attending or hosting, Enterlink helps you tailor your VR and online
				experiences to your interests.

				California. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, please
				discontinue using our platform.
			</p>

				and patience as we refine and improve our services. Thank you for being
				part of the Enterlink community—we’re excited to embark on this virtual
				journey with you!
